##### GLOBAL GITIGNORE #####
## This file allows the git repo to ignore certain files that may not be desirable
## to store in the repository. Examples are generated files, compiled files, user-
## modified files, etc. All files that should be ignored are listed in this file.
##
## Some exceptions exist to ignore patterns. These are files that should  be included
## in the repository even if they match an ignore pattern. They are listed with with
## and ! in front of the line. While git doesn't techinically need this if it's already
## tracking the excepted files, it helps to document that a file should be explicitly
## included in the repository.
